# README

**NOTE:**  Update 22/01/2024 This code is complete and works.  This example is using React.

## What is this project about?

Next.id has API which allow you to associate social medial handles with a Decentralised ID (DID).

This is example code showing how to associate a twitter X social media handle with a next.id DID.

Note next.id calls your DID an avatar.

This example uses Meta Mask wallet to do the required signing so that the user does not need to 
manage their own private key.

The public key is recovered from meta mask using the viem library.

The viem library also signs the verify payload response to produce the data required to build the
twitter tweet.  Once the tweet has been sent manually by the user, they click share and get the
tweet number from the URL.  They paste that number in a box so that the tweet can be verified.

So the user steps are:

(i) Paste twitter X handle into the box without the @ symbol

(ii) Press Next

(iv) Meta Mask will pop up a couple of times asking to sign stuff

(v) The text to paste into a tweet will be shown.

(vi) Paste the twitter text into a tweet and send it.

(vii) Click Share for the tweet and take the ID from the URL and paste it in the box.  Then press
      verify.

  If all is well you will be shown a message that the x handle was added to your DID.

  Else you will be shown an error message.

## Do you want to get involved?

JD is busy integrating next.id DID technology with UTU Trust.

JD is building a next.id DID management standalone react app which allows end users to manage their next.id DIDs.

That project is here:

https://github.com/spotadev/utu-endorse-nextid

JD is also building DID and Utu Trust into a social media platform which explores:

* filtering comments by next.id and trust
* user based self censorship

The social media platform has 2 variants:

* chrome extension
* one page app

You can also get involved with UTU Trust.  UTU Trust has bounty programmes for involving the community.
